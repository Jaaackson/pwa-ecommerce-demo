### In maintenance mode
* This is based on Web Starter Kit (0.6.4) which is [no longer being 
maintained](https://github.com/google/web-starter-kit/issues/940)
* The code still runs, but note deprecation warnings from NPM.
* This repository is in maintenance mode -- security issues are getting fixed, but new development would require taking it off the Web Starter Kit.
* The PaymentRequest code [fails on Safari](https://github.com/google-developer-training/pwa-ecommerce-demo/issues/18). The linked issue supplements the lab notes and contains instructions for fixing it.
